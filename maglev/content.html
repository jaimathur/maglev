                        <p><b><u>Magnetic Levitation</u></b>

<br>
The Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) unit demonstrates closed loop levitation of permanent and ferromagnetic elements. The unit used for our experiments is shown in Figures 1 and 2, and the magnetic disc is shown in Figure 3.
<br><br>

<img src="3.png" style="width:400px; height:364px; margin-left:20%;" ><br />

<p align="justify">The plant consists of upper and lower coils that produce a magnetic field in response to a DC current. A magnet (or sometimes even two magnets) travels along a glass guide rod. By energizing the lower coil, a single magnet is levitated through a repulsive magnetic force. As the current in the coil increases, the field strength increases and the levitated magnet height is increased. For the upper coil, the levitating force is attractive.</p>

<p align="justify">Up to two magnets may be controlled simultaneously by stacking them on the glass rod. The magnets are of ultra-high field strength and are designed to provide large levitated displacements to clearly demonstrate the principle of levitation and motion control. Two laser-based sensors measure the magnet positions. The lower sensor is typically used to measure a given magnet position in proximity to the lower coil, and the upper one for proximity to the upper coil.</p>


<p align="justify">The unit can be set up in the stable and unstable (repulsive and attractive fields) configurations. If two magnets and coils are used, the field interaction between the magnets causes strong cross coupling and thus produces a true multivariable system. Thus, magnets can be added or removed to provide single loop or multi-loop plants that are stable or unstable. These configurations are illustrated in Figure 4 below.</p>

<img src="5.png" style="width:500px; height:485px; margin-left:20%;"> 


<p align="justify">Most experiments deal with the so-called configuration1 shown in Figures 5 and 6. It is a configuration in which the lower magnet is levitated by exciting the lower electromagnetic coil. The excitation of the lower electromagnet causes the repulsive force on the magnetic disc. The repulsive force in turn levitates the magnetic disc. It is a stable configuration.</p>

<p>1. Visit all the tabs given on this website, especially visit the 'Introduction' tab, and read the overall description &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about Magnetic levitation. Also, see the list of experiments under 'List of experiments' tab.</p> <br>

 

<p>2. You have to do the experiments in sequential order, that is first do experiment 1, then experiment 2, then  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiment 3, and so on. Do not jump over to any experiment, without doing all the earlier experiments and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submitting their results.</p> <br>
 
 

<p>3. Now proceed to do the experiments, one by one.</p> <br>

 

<p>4. For each experiment, you will find various tabs, such as: Aim, Introduction, Theory, Procedure, Experiment, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiz, and Things to think about.</p> <br>
 
 

<p>5. Begin by clicking on Experiment 1. Read the Aim, Introduction, Theory, and Procedure. Understand what is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given in these topics, and become familiar with the procedure.</p> <br>

 

<p>6. When you are ready to perform the experiment, click on the Experiment tab. Follow the procedure (as given &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the previous tab). </p> <br>

 

<p>7. Go to the Quiz section by clicking on the Quiz tab and answer all the quiz questions and press Submit.</p> <br>

 

<p>8. Lastly, visit the section Things to Think About, by clicking on the tab. In this section, some advanced questions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are given. You are to think over, discuss, and perform any additional experiments, to arrive at the answers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this section, we do not provide the right answers. So, you have to figure them out yourself and get them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluated by your instructor (if required).</p>
